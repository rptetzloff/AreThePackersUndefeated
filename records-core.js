 *  inside it would rename fields on files that have nothing to do with games.
 *
 *  This is the seam the Brewers repo gets for free, because Retrosheet's raw
 *  columns are nothing like the ones its code wants and its parser has to build
 *  the row anyway. Here the CSV very nearly is the internal shape, which is why
 *  the team name ended up in the field names: the file has a column literally
 *  called "Packers Win".
 *
 *  Mapping it here means every function above reads `result` and `scoreFor`,
 *  and the data file is free to be regenerated with different headers — which
 *  it will need to be, since the shared core wants rows carrying team ids
 *  rather than rows already flattened to one club's point of view.

// It was a literal until site.js gained the same list, and two lists that must
// agree are one list read twice — the copy that drifts is the one nobody is
// looking at. site.js is the source because it is where a sport says what
// records it has, and adding a card is then a one-line change in one file.
//
// Kept as an export so the four call sites in lib/records.js and records.js
// did not have to change.
