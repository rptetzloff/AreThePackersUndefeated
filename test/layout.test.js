// The records page shipped as one tall column of cards at every viewport above
// 600px and the whole suite stayed green: the catalogue tests prove the twelve
// cards exist and the superlatives tests prove their contents, and neither has
// any opinion about how wide the thing they render into is. The failure lived
// entirely in a missing declaration in styles.css.
//
// Reading CSS as text is crude, but the alternative is a headless browser and
// this repo has no runtime dependencies on purpose. Parsing declarations
// exactly — rather than searching the block for a substring — is what makes it
// trustworthy: `max-width` contains `width`, so a substring check would pass on
// the very stylesheet that had the bug.
