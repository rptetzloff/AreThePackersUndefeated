// Render pages with a real browser and compare two builds byte for byte.
//
// Every defect this repo shipped in August was invisible to `node --test` and
// obvious the moment something rendered the page: the records grid that read as
// correct while collapsing to one column, and every past season showing 0-0
// while 118 tests passed. The check that found both was a browser, a screenshot
// and a diff — run by hand, and got wrong three times in one afternoon.
//
// The ways it was wrong are the reason this file exists. Each produced a *green*
// result that meant nothing:
//
//   1. Comparing a build against itself. The check for "is the server running
//      the new code" matched a substring that appeared in both. See fingerprint.
//   2. Comparing two empty pages. The panel under test was hidden in both
//      captures, so "identical" was true and worthless. See markers.
//   3. Comparing noise. The on-this-day panel picks at random, so pages differ
//      between runs of the same build. See the pinned query strings below.
//   4. Generalising from one page. Screenshots were called reproducible on the
//      strength of three captures of /records; five other pages paint a live
//      clock and differ every run. See `pixels: false`.
//
// A tool that can still make those mistakes silently is not an improvement on
// doing it by hand, which is why each has a guard and each guard has a test.
//
// Usage:
//
//   node scripts/render-check.mjs capture out/before
//   git switch some-branch
//   node scripts/render-check.mjs capture out/after
//   node scripts/render-check.mjs diff out/before out/after
//
// No dependencies, and no browser is downloaded: it uses the Chrome or Edge
// already on the machine. Set CHROME to override the path.

 *  `markers` is the guard against a comparison that passes because both sides

 *  quietly recorded, because a hidden panel is exactly the state in which two
 *  builds agree for the wrong reason.
 *
 *  The query strings are not decoration. `otd` pins the on-this-day date, whose
 *  panel otherwise picks a random game and differs between two runs of the same
 *  build. 02-05 is one of only seven dates with exactly one candidate, which
 *  makes the choice deterministic — and it lands on Super Bowl XLV, so the
 *  championship path is one of the ones being compared.
